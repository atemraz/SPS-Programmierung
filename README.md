# SPS Praktikum Projects - Conveyor Control, Sequential Automation, and HMI

This repository showcases selected projects from my SPS programming lab at Hochschule Koblenz.

## About the Projects

### V4: Conveyor Motor Control
- Analog input read and scaled to control conveyor motor speed
- Soft start functionality to protect mechanical parts
- LED blink function based on input voltage ranges

### V5: Sequential Control and Safety
- State machine for conveyor motor control
- Safety features like dominant shutdown, wire break protection
- Flip-Flop based motor control (Wendesch√ºtz-Schaltung)

### V6: HMI Visualization and High-Speed Counter
- HMI (Comfort Panel) for user interaction (Start/Stop control, live motor speed display)
- Real-time graphical display of motor speed and conveyor belt status
- High-Speed Counter (HSC) setup to track conveyor belt movement accurately
